# Chicken Sandwich Rankings

Here is my attempt to find the greatest chicken sandwich in the world. I
have chosen the following criteria.

## Presentation

How does the chicken sandwich look? Does the sandwich match the ads in visual
presentation?

Numeric 0-10

## Chicken

Is the chicken nice and juicy? How is the mouth-feel of the chicken breast?

Numeric 0-10


## Spice

How does the chicken breast itself taste? Are there a good mix of spices that
give good flavor to the sandwich.

Numeric 0-10

## Sauce

How does the sauce taste? Does it balance well with the sandwich? Is it a unique
flavor?

Numeric 0-10

## Crunch

Is the chicken breast breaded well with a nice satisfying crunch?

Numeric 0-10

## Pickled Things

Does the sandwich have pickled things and how do those pickled things taste?

Numeric 0-3

## X-factor

Does this sandwich do something out of the ordinary and does it work to the
favor of the overall sandwich?

Numeric 0-3

## Calculation

The final rating is computed using the following formula.

```
(Presentation + Chicken + Spice + Sauce + Crunch + Pickled Things + X-factor) / 5
```

In this way, the rating is an average of the first 5 categories with the ability
to add some extra points due to X-factor and Pickled things. As such, it is
possible for a sandwich to score above 10, however, it is highly unlikely. I
wonder if such a sandwich even exists.
