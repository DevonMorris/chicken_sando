# Chicken Sandwich Rankings

Here is my attempt to find the greatest chicken sandwich in the world. I
have chosen the following criteria.

## Presentation

How does the chicken sandwich look? Does the sandwich match the ads in visual
presentation?

Numeric 0-10

## Chicken

Is the chicken nice and juicy? How is the mouth-feel of the chicken breast?

Numeric 0-10


## Spice

How does the chicken breast itself taste? Are there a good mix of spices that
give good flavor to the sandwich.

Numeric 0-10

## Sauce

How does the sauce taste? Does it balance well with the sandwich? Is it a unique
flavor?

Numeric 0-10

## Crunch

Is the chicken breast breaded well with a nice satisfying crunch?

Numeric 0-10

## Pickled Things

Does the sandwich have pickled things and how do those pickled things taste?

Numeric 0-3

## X-factor

Does this sandwich do something out of the ordinary and does it work to the
favor of the overall sandwich?

Numeric 0-3

## Calculation

The final rating is computed using the following formula.

```
(Presentation + Chicken + Spice + Sauce + Crunch + Pickled Things + X-factor) / 5
```

In this way, the rating is an average of the first 5 categories with the ability
to add some extra points due to X-factor and Pickled things. As such, it is
possible for a sandwich to score above 10, however, it is highly unlikely. I
wonder if such a sandwich even exists.

## Notable Sandwiches

### Worst Chicken Sandwich
I was convinced to order a chicken sandwich from "El Ranchero" in blacksburg.
Honestly, this is the worst piece of food I have ever eaten. I couldn't tell if
the patty had sat in the freezer for more than a year or if it had sat in the
frier for the same amount of time. The patty literally stopped my front two
teeth as I tried to bite it. I had to masticate quite vigorously to break this
patty and as I did it turned into the equivalent of chicken sawdust in my
mouth. The only saving grace of this sandwich was the "white sauce" which
although too sweet for my tastebuds was a welcome respite from the absolute
piece of trash that was this sandwich.

Score: 1.8
